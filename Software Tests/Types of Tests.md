1. **Integration Testing**: Tests how well the units or components work together. It focuses on the interfaces between units.
2. **System Testing**: Tests the entire system as a whole. It checks if the software meets the specified requirements and functions properly in the intended environment.
3. **Acceptance Testing**: Also known as user acceptance testing (UAT), this involves testing the software to ensure it meets the acceptance criteria set by the stakeholders or end users.
4. **Regression Testing**: Tests to ensure that recent changes or additions to the software have not adversely affected existing features.
5. **Performance Testing**: Tests the performance of the software under various conditions such as load, stress, and scalability to ensure it meets performance requirements.
6. **Security Testing**: Tests the software to identify vulnerabilities and ensure that data and resources are protected from unauthorized access and attacks.
7. **Usability Testing**: Tests the software from a user's perspective to ensure that it is easy to use, intuitive, and provides a good user experience.
8. **Compatibility Testing**: Tests the software to ensure it works correctly across different devices, operating systems, browsers, and networks.
9. **Localization and Internationalization Testing**: Tests the software to ensure it can be adapted for different languages, regions, and cultures without losing functionality or usability.

These are some of the fundamental types of software tests, and there are many more specialized types that address specific aspects or requirements of the software.
