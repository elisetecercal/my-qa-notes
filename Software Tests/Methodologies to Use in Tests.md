# Methodologies to Use in Tests

Methodologies commonly used in software testing:

1. **Waterfall Model**: A traditional sequential approach where testing is conducted after development phases are completed.
2. **V-Model**: A variation of the waterfall model where testing is emphasized at each stage of development.
3. **Agile Testing**: Testing is integrated into the agile development process, with continuous feedback and iteration throughout development cycles.
4. **Scrum Testing**: A specific implementation of agile testing, where testing activities are aligned with the Scrum framework's sprints.
5. **Kanban Testing**: Another agile methodology where testing activities are managed through visual boards, emphasizing continuous delivery and flow.
6. **DevOps Testing**: Integrates testing into the entire software development and delivery pipeline, promoting collaboration between development and operations teams.
7. **Continuous Testing**: Testing activities are automated and integrated into the software delivery pipeline, ensuring rapid feedback on changes.
8. **Exploratory Testing**: Testing is conducted dynamically and adaptively, with testers exploring the software to discover defects and unexpected behavior.
9. **Risk-Based Testing**: Testing efforts are prioritized based on the risks associated with different features or components of the software.
10. **Model-Based Testing**: Test cases are derived from models of the software's behavior, such as state diagrams or finite state machines.
11. **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Testing is driven by desired behaviors or specifications, with tests written in natural language using tools like Cucumber or SpecFlow.
12. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Tests are written before the code is implemented, with the goal of driving the design and ensuring code correctness.
13. **Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)**: Similar to TDD, but focused on defining acceptance criteria before writing tests and code.
14. **Shift-Left Testing**: Testing activities are moved earlier in the development process, allowing defects to be identified and addressed sooner.
15. **Shift-Right Testing**: Testing activities continue after deployment, with a focus on monitoring and gathering feedback from real-world usage.

These methodologies vary in their approach to planning, execution, and integration of testing activities within the software development lifecycle. Choosing the right methodology depends on factors such as project requirements, team dynamics, and organizational culture.
